I am a Ph.D. student in Economics at Bocconi University. Before starting my doctoral studies, I worked as a pre-doctoral researcher at the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano on a project examining renewable energy and electricity markets from an industrial organization perspective. I remain involved in this project, which has deepened my interest in empirical IO. I am also strongly interested in Econometric Theory, a passion I developed during my M.A. in Economics at Collegio Carlo Alberto in Turin. The rigorous training I received there—comparable to a Ph.D.-level curriculum—proved invaluable during my pre-doctoral experience.
